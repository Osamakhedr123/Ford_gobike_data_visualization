# Ford GoBike System data
You can find data for this project on [this link](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data)

# Dataset:  
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The dataset contains 15 features (columns) and 174952 entries (rows) for customers and subscribers of the Ford GoBike company.  

# Summary of Findings:  
In the exploration process, I found that most trips take approximately 5-25 minutes. And after looking for ages in relation to trip duration I found out that people from age 25-40 represent the vast majority of the dataset and most of them take approximately 5-25 minutes in their trips. Next, I investigated the relation between week days and the number of trips to find out that the day of the week with the most number of trips is Thursday, interestingly the days with the least numbers of trips are Saturday and Sunday. I also found out that most members of the dataset are subscribers. and also found out that males number is significantly larger than females and other genders among subscribers and customers. I also noticed a spike in the trip duration for other genders before the age of 60. I also found out that trip duration for customers is bigger than subscribers in average, however the number of subscribers is significantly larger than customers.

# Key Insights for Presentation:  
I found that the day of the week with the most number of trips is Thursday and the days with the least numbers of trips are Saturday and Sunday This might indicate that more than half of the trips are work related. since in the weekends the number of trips drops significantly (by approximately half of the total average).
I also found that most members are males between the age of 5-40, this might mean that the company should focus on targeting this Category of people more.
